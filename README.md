# Travel Assistant

An AI travel assistant built with LangGraph, LangChain, and Streamlit.

## Features

- **Smart Travel Assistant**: Uses Ollama - local LLMs
- **Real-time Data**: Weather API (OpenWeatherMap) and web search API (Tavily)
- **Clean Chat Interface**: Streamlit-based UI focused on conversation
- **Memory & Context**: Maintains conversation history across interactions in-chat

## Project Structure

```

## Setup

0. **Install Ollama** from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment** (create `.env` file):
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   ```

3. **Start Ollama / Open terminal** and pull the model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```

## Usage

### Streamlit Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Features:
- Clean chat interface (user/assistant messages only)

## API Keys

- **Weather**: Get free API key from [OpenWeatherMap - Used the free 5 day forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- **Web Search**: Get API key from [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)

Both are optional - the app provides fallback responses when APIs are unavailable.

## Model Configuration

Supported Ollama models:
- `llama3.2` (default) - Fast, efficient
- `llama3.1` - Larger context window
- `qwen2.5` - Alternative option
- `mistral` - Lightweight option

Configure via environment variable or Streamlit sidebar.

## Architecture

This travel assistant uses a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) architecture** where the agent:

1. **Reasons** about the user's query
2. **Acts** by calling tools when needed (weather API, web search)
3. **Observes** the tool results  
4. **Responds** with informed, up-to-date information

The modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new tools in `src/tools.py`
- Modify agent behavior in `src/agent.py` 
- Update prompts in `src/prompts.py`
- Extend the UI in `streamlit_app.py`

## Example Queries

- "What should I pack for Tokyo next week?"
- "Warm places to visit in November?"
- "Top attractions in Rome for a day trip"
- "Weather in Barcelona today"

## Usage Examples

## Architecture

### LangGraph Workflow
```
User Input ‚Üí Context Management ‚Üí Query Classification ‚Üí External Data Check ‚Üí Data Fetching (if needed) ‚Üí Response Generation
```

### Key Components
- **State Management**: Typed state with conversation history
- **Query Classification**: Automatic categorization of user queries
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation memory and user preferences
- **External APIs**: Weather and country information integration
- **Conditional Routing**: Smart workflow decisions based on query needs

### Prompt Engineering Highlights
- Role-based system prompts for each query type
- Chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning
- Few-shot examples for consistent classification
- Context-aware response generation

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `langgraph`: Workflow orchestration
- `langchain`: LLM integration framework
- `langchain-ollama`: Ollama integration
- `requests`: External API calls
- `python-dotenv`: Environment configuration

### External APIs
- **Weather**: OpenWeatherMap API (falls back to mock data)
- **Country Info**: REST Countries API (public, no key required)

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- Network timeouts for external APIs
- Missing API keys (falls back to mock data)  
- Ollama connection issues
- Malformed user inputs
- LLM generation errors
